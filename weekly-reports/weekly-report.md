# Week 2 - 8/28, 8/31
8/28 - Helped a few people with the rhino/GH files. Tried setting up the phone stand model in Rhino 8 WIP, but the phone stand doesn't generate even when all plugins are installed. The <code>OpenNest</code> plugin isn't detected by RhinoWIP correctly. Reverted back to Rhino 7.

Did the icebreaker logo in Affinity Designer as I'm comfortable with it and haven't used Figma before.

During TJ's GH tutorial - I played around and made a completely pointless _make the smallest box possible_ grasshopper file.
