# Week 2 - 8/28, 8/31
8/28 - Helped a few people with the rhino/GH file. Tried setting up the phone stand model in Rhino 8 WIP, but the phone stand doesn't generate even when all plugins are installed. The <code>OpenNest</code> plugin isn't detected by RhinoWIP correctly. Reverted back to Rhino 7.

Did the icebreaker logo in Affinity Designer as I'm comfortable with it and haven't used Figma before.
